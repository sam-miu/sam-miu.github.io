Assignment Report:

This assignment contains two main parts. One is developing animation for the webpage, and another one is rewriting the JS logic code from Lab5 using map/filter/reduce instead of for loop.

The first part - developing animation, took me about 3 hours. It was really challenging and difficult at the same time for me, but I did enjoy seeing the animation results. The animations were smooth and full of excitement to me.
However, I believe I might only complete 90% of the requirements in this first part, but still I think I did my best and I did not give up on doing it. It was another new and great experience for me.

The second part - rewriting the logic code from the previous lab. It was my most favorite part of this assignment. I enjoyed creating different solutions using different methods for the same problem. It was quite easy for me. It took me only 15 minutes to complete the second part.

Overall, this assignment was another improvement for me.
