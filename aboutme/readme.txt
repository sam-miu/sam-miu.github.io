Course: 472 | WAP
Lab: 2

A. I have completely finished this lab 2 correctly with the right results for all 2 assignments.

B. I hereby declare that this submission is my own original work and to the best of my knowledge it contains no materials previously published or written by another person. I am aware that submitting solutions that are not my own work will result in an NC of the course.
I am aware that I am not allowed to share solutions with other students.
I am aware that if I submit only parts of this lab that points will be subtracted.
I am aware that if my lab submission does not contain this readme.txt file that I do not get points for this lab.

C. The only blocker part was in the assignment 1 where I needed to upload the aboutme to MUM's webpage, but the provided link by the lab showed 404, so I will attach the aboutme.html as file instead. 404v Error => http://mumstudents.org/cs472/2015-10-AS/static_pages/upload.shtml.
